# Degree of difficulty: Medium

# First count the number of consecutive 0s in each row from back to front.
# Then find the smallest number of rows that can meet the number of 0 in the current or subsequent rows of each row.
# If it cannot meet the requirement, return -1. 
# If it is satisfied, shift the elements in the array between current row and the row before found row after the element of the found row. 
# The number of steps plus the found row minus the current row.

# complexity: O(nÂ²)
